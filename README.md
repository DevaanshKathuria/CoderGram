### **1. Problem Statement**

While platforms like Instagram excel at general social connection, they lack the features and community focus that would benefit coders. Similarly, code-centric platforms like GitHub prioritize collaboration over social interaction and sharing of personal experiences. There is a clear need for a platform that combines the social aspects of Instagram with a community and features designed for coders.

### **2. Proposed Solution**

**CoderGram** is a full-stack social media platform, available as both a website and a mobile app (iOS and Android), that allows coders to connect, share their work, and showcase their skills. Users can post pictures of their coding setups, share project updates, and engage with a community of like-minded individuals.

  * **Personalized Social Feed:** A dynamic feed displays posts from the users you follow.
  * **Customizable User Profiles:** Each user gets a profile page to showcase their projects, skills, and personal information.
  * **Post Creation & Management:** Users can create and upload posts with images and descriptions.
  * **Following System:** A simple and intuitive system to follow other coders.
  * **Interactive Engagement:** Users can like and comment on posts.

### **4. Target Users**

  * **Coders & Developers:** Professionals who want to share their journey and connect with others.
  * **Students:** Computer science students looking to build a network and get inspiration.
  * **Tech Enthusiasts:** Anyone passionate about technology and coding.
